# pypasswordgenerator
In fact nowadays all sort of comapnies seem to be hacked these days. Right?<br>
Ya! Everybody seem to bad at keeping your password safe.Actually I came upto know how these passwords are hacked.One of the most common reson is "PASSWORD REUSE" using the same password in different sites from google to your spotify. The problem is that when one of these sites get hacked then the email and password combination you used to signup is compromised.
So all hackers like me try out those credintials on abunch of other websites and see if they are hacked.If it so all your social media and websites blast it will be in our hands.So for you to help i came up with a solution "PYPASSWORD GENERATOR" with letters symbols and alphabets too..  
TBP:There is some more to be coded for most user friendly and more facilitesðŸ¤ŸðŸ¤ŸðŸ¤ŸðŸ¤Ÿ..
